            <li>
              <p>A new NSHSS survey reveals that Gen Z (9-24)  is OVER working from home. More than 75% of them want to go back to work.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>According to the survey, they are over ZOOM, remote learning during the pandemic turned them off. The kids are zoomed out.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Gen Z desires networking and mentorship. Because of the lack of in-person mentoring throughout the pandemic, Gen Z is having a more challenging time navigating workplace norms (knowing how to act right at work) and forming meaningful connections at a crucial stage in their career development</p>

            Wall Street Journal blasts Elon Musk for creeping with Google co-founder’s wife
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>According to a shocking report published on Sunday by the Wall Street Journal, Elon Musk allegedly had a brief hookup with the wife of Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, last fall.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>This allegedly led to Sergey Brin’s filing for divorce and the breakup of the long-standing friendship between the two tech billionaires.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
              Messy Musky called it a “hit piece." He shared a selfie with Sergey on Twitter and even said they partied together the night before and it was “positive vibes.” The allegations have since been denied by Sergey's soon-to-be ex-wife, Nicole Shanahan.

            Ex Coinbase manager locked up for insider trading

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Ishan Wahi, a former Coinbase product manager, and two other people were charged with insider trading on the Coinbase exchange that netted them about $1.5 million.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>This is the first case, that we know of, of insider trading in the cryptocurrency sector. While working at Coinbase, these guys sold information to third parties and made investments in cryptocurrencies before they were listed on the exchange using their insider knowledge.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
              Ishan Wahi and his brother Nikhil Wahi were taken into custody at the airport, trying to catch a flight to India. Sameer Ramani, Wahi's buddy and partner, is still at large.
